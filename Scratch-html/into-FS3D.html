<p>TOO LAGGY? TRY PHOSPHORUS VERSION:
<br />─►http://phosphorus.github.io/#74221074◄─
<br />S/X - throttle || arrows - roll/pitch || A/D - yaw || C - inside view
<br />space - decrease speed || R - missile || W - show/hide wheels
<br />slide to rotate camera (only outside the plane)
<br />To TAKE OFF EASILY press S and then DOWN ARROW
<br />
<br />Note: 2nd airstrip is far forward, use minimap (these white dots on the bottom of screen) and land if possible
<br />

<br />Thanks to @sticku for introduction to the matrix rotation.
<br />
<br />v2.8 - 25th May - more realistic physics, runway filled in.
<br />v2.7 - 6th May - plane under water becomes blue, small bug fixed
<br />v2.6 - 18th April - ...RIVER!!! :D see it on right side from the plane
<br />v2.5 - 13th December - Wings also collides with mountains, improved physics
<br />v2.4 - 11th December - FILLED MOUNTAINS! Also a little improved control and changed vector graphics so now it looks well on phosporus too.
<br />v2.3 - 19th October - different hill heights, rocket can break rocks
<br />v2.2 - 25th September - better looking and working rocket, hud in place is rotating (inside view)
<br />v2.1 - 24th September - contrasting plane color, transparent windows in plane, repaired glitches (physics, shadows) - as many as I saw, tell me if I missed any of tchem, head moving inside plane
<br />v2.0 - 20th September - "glitching?" inside view, press 'C' - note: this update took me more than the rest of this project :O
<br />v1.9 - 7th September - new physics - gliding / rudder
<br />v1.8 - 6th September - missile - R to fire, some glitches repaired
<br />v1.7 - 5th September - space helps slow down, another airstrip, upgraded fire (with sorting), simple minimap
<br />v1.6 - 5th September - improved physics and crashing system, simple fire, again small bug repaired with culling
<br />v1.5 - 4th September - wheels (press W), culling for plane added, for hills repaired, air density gets lower when going higher
<br />v1.4 - 3rd September - physics on rocks improved, repeatable world generator, face culling
<br />v1.3 - 2nd September - rudder control, upgraded physics, graphics
<br />v1.2 - 1st September - moveable wings, possible to roll-over
<br />v1.1 - 31st August - release version, plane with physics and shadow, hills, sun, fog effect
<br />v0.8 - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22322639/
